description: Distill the current rumble/design conversation into one or more buildable GitHub task issues (type:task) for the {{project}} pipeline — and stop there. Use when the user says "task out", "make this a task", "send this to the pipeline", or at the end of a design discussion.

# Rumble → task issue

You are ending a design/rumble session. Distill what was concluded into one or more GitHub
issues in `{{repo}}` that the pipeline can build **without access to this conversation**.
The issue is the entire contract — write it for an agent with zero context.

## Process

1. Identify each independently shippable conclusion. One issue per shippable unit; do not
   bundle unrelated work. Order them; declare `Depends on: #NN, #MM` where an issue must
   not build before another closes.
2. **Split for the pipeline's cost curve**: an issue whose implementation would exceed
   ~{{limits.split_lines}} lines is two issues (core / app, schema / routes, service /
   client) with `Depends on:`, not one issue the architect cuts later. Put every choice the
   rumble decided into Context **as a decision, not an option** — a choice left open costs an
   architect or a fix round to absorb. Reserve the `D-`/`G-`/`M-` numbers the issue will
   need and say so.
3. Draft each issue with the body below, show the draft(s) to the user for a quick confirm
   (they may adjust scope).
4. Create with `gh issue create -R {{repo}} --title "…" --label type:task --body-file
   <tmpfile>`. If the work belongs to a user story or epic, mention `Part of #NN` in
   Context and add the new number to the parent's task list.
5. Do NOT add routing labels (`area:*`, `size:*`, `risk:*`, `{{labels.build}}`) — triage
   stamps them; your suggestion goes in the body.
6. Post the run order on the umbrella (or on the last issue): the waves of free issues and
   their `Depends on:` lines, so the orchestrator can start a wave without this session.
7. **Stop here.** Tell the user the issue numbers and that the pipeline runs them **in a
   new session** — `{{runtime.skill_prefix}}pipeline <number>` for one issue,
   `{{runtime.skill_prefix}}pipeline <umbrella>` or `{{runtime.skill_prefix}}pipeline` for
   the free ones in waves. This session does not triage, design, implement or review
   anything: the rumble context is dead weight for the orchestrator and would ride along in
   every pipeline turn. If the user says "go" here, say that the next step is a new session
   with `{{runtime.skill_prefix}}pipeline`, and — if there is a next arc to rumble — name it.

## Body

```
## Goal
<one sentence: what exists after this that does not now>

## Context
<decisions from the rumble the implementer must honor — including what we decided NOT to
do. Link docs by path and decisions by id (D-xxx, G-xxx, M-xxx). Reserved numbers.>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <testable statement>
- [ ] <testable statement>

## Test expectations
<what kind of test / measurement proves this works; what only a human on a device can do>

## Out of scope
<explicit non-goals>

Depends on: #NN, #MM        <!-- only if needed, exactly this format -->

## Suggested routing
area:<x> · size:<S|M|L> · risk:<low|medium|high> — triage makes the final call
```

## Quality bar

Reject your own draft if an implementer would need to ask a question this session already
answered — put that answer in Context. Acceptance criteria must be testable. Out of scope
is the #1 defense against scope creep — never leave it empty. A number that only a human can
measure is written as "pending" with the steps, never as a target dressed as a result.
