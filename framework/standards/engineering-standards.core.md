# {{project}} Engineering Standards

Binding for every agent in this repo. Repo conventions live in `{{runtime.guide_file}}`; on conflicts of
style the guide wins, on conflicts of safety this document wins.

## Reuse before writing

- Before adding a function, type or module: search the workspace for an existing one. Extend
  or reuse; do not duplicate. A third near-copy means extract a shared helper instead.
- Prefer what the platform already gives us over reimplementing. If you replace something existing, cite the measurement that justifies it.

## Correctness & tests

- Every behavior change ships with tests that fail without the change; tests assert
  behavior, not implementation.
- Run the full verify board before handing over; a red board is never handed on.
- Anything measurable (latency, accuracy, event loss, cost) gets measured and written to
  `{{docs.measurements}}` when the number matters for a decision.
{{#if has_mandatory}}- **Mandatory suites by path** — the rule is a path predicate, not a file list; a fixed list
  drifts the day a new registration site appears:{{#each mandatory}}
  - diff touches {{item.when_line}} → `{{item.run}}` is part of the verify board regardless of
    what the PR otherwise names; a red result ({{item.red_when}}) is a red finding, never a nit;
    the PR states the result honestly{{#if item.honest_line}} ("{{item.honest_line}}"){{/if}} ({{item.rule}}).{{/each}}
{{/if}}

## Security & privacy

- No secrets in code, logs or errors; configuration from the environment.
- Validate and type all external input at the boundary (messages, tool arguments, manifests,
  HTTP, paths).
- Least privilege: capabilities deny-by-default; tokens and credentials scoped; no inbound
  ports the design does not name.
- New dependencies need a one-line justification in the task log (what, why, alternative
  considered); prefer well-maintained dependencies with permissive licenses (Apache/MIT).
- Always `risk:high`: {{risk_high}}.

## Efficiency

- No premature optimization, but no obvious waste: no blocking work in async hot paths,
  no unbounded channels/collections, no lock held across `.await`, no per-event allocation
  storms.

## Maintainability

- Small focused modules; code reads like the surrounding code (idiom, naming, comment density).
- Doc comments on public APIs and non-obvious constraints only.
- Conventional commits, no AI co-author trailers.
- Architecture-shaping decisions get a `D-xxx` entry (or a `G-xxx` if genuinely open);
  do not decide silently in code.

## "v1" is a claim, not a label

Shipping something as "v1" / "for now" / "deferred" is allowed only when it is the smaller
**correct** thing — never as a nicer word for unfinished. Every such claim must name, in the
same PR:

- **what is unfinished about it**, concretely, and
- **the condition that triggers the next step** — a measurement threshold, a pending
  decision (`G-xxx`), or a usage signal. Not "later", not "when we have time".

That pair lives in a `G-` row; a "v1" without one is not a v1, it is unfinished work with a
label. Reviewers treat a missing trigger condition like a missing test. Where a residual is
genuinely irreducible (a peer can lie, a distinction is undecidable), say so plainly and pin
it with a test that goes red if someone ever closes it — a documented limit always beats an
invented guarantee.

Corollary for risk: a known residual risk to **honesty or safety** is closed by engineering,
not accepted by note. If closing it would gut the feature, hand the trade to {{human}} with both
costs quantified instead of choosing silently.

## A check that cannot produce the case is not a check

Four times in one arc of the project this rule was written in, work passed because the *verification* could not reach the defect —
never because anyone skipped a step:

- a reasoning-leak detector whose trigger fired on a tag its own filter consumed, so the
  documented case was the one case it could not see;
- a formatting scan whose regex required a letter after the run, and the one defect had a
  bracket there;
- test scripts that never used more than one acting call per round, so a whole bug class
  was unreachable for three review rounds;
- a 252-cell matrix that bounded a length from below but never from above, so deleting the
  clause that distinguishes the default mode from the widest one left every test green.

**A green result from a check that cannot produce the case looks exactly like a green result
from a sound one.** So:

- When a test, scan or eval defends a property, state the *shape* it must be able to see,
  and confirm it can: **mutate the code and watch it go red.** An assertion no mutation
  breaks is decoration.
- Prefer enumerating a space to sampling a point. If the matrix is too large to write by
  hand, that is the argument for generating it, not for picking one case.
- Derive expectations from what the thing *means*, by hand. An expectation read back from
  the implementation cannot catch the implementation.
- Absence assertions need a companion presence assertion in the same run, or they pass by
  the case never being produced.
- Verify a claim by re-reading the artifact, not the report — read each caption against its
  own table, each doc comment against the code beneath it. Grep for the wording you
  *retracted*, not the wording you remember.

Corollary observed the same day: **the number that goes stale is reliably the one that
flattered us.** When prose and table disagree, expect the prose to be the optimistic one,
and be most suspicious of drift in that direction.

## A reference without an anchor is a red finding

Four times in one arc of the project this rule was written in, code or docs referenced
something that did not exist: a doc comment promising a lever no code called, a mapping the
doc claimed and a dead branch never performed, a comment citing a gap row nobody had written,
and three gap links plus a measurement id pointing at rows that were never created.

Each read like housekeeping; each was a false statement in the tree — the reader who follows
the reference finds nothing, and builds on the promise anyway. So:

- A reference to a D-/G-/M-row, a lever, a function, or a mapping that does not exist is a
  **red finding**, not a style nit. Fix is one of two: create the anchor now, or change the
  reference to state what actually exists (a declared handover to a named split counts;
  a bare "will come later" does not).
- Writing the anchor may cross a split boundary: correcting a false statement in the tree
  outranks "that document belongs to a later split" (same rule as for doc rows made false
  by a merge).
- Reviewers grep the diff's references (`G-\d+`, `M-\d+`, `D-\d+`, named functions/levers in
  prose) against the tree as a standard pass.
- The same pass covers **self-declared gaps**: a comment admitting "unwitnessed", "no test
  drives this", "unproven" must point at the G-row or issue that collects it. A note naming a gap
  is a confession, not a net; the anchor is what makes someone come back for it.

## Escalation (all agents)

Stop and escalate — comment the findings on the issue and add the label
`needs-human` with {{human}} as assignee — instead of guessing, when:

- The spec is ambiguous about user-visible or safety-relevant behavior.
- The task needs a destructive/irreversible action (deleting data, changing auth/policy
  semantics, force-push) that the spec does not explicitly call for.
- Verification cannot be made green within budget.
- The task is much larger than its `size:*` (say what you found).

An escalated task is a success. Guessing is the failure mode.
